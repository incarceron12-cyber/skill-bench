# Benchmark Design Taxonomy

This is the canonical design map for converting domain expertise into a valid,
diagnosable knowledge-work benchmark. `docs/state-of-the-art-map.md` tracks the
external landscape; this document defines `skill-bench`'s internal objects and
boundaries. Reviews and reports retain source-specific detail rather than being
copied here.

## 1. Three different taxonomies

Earlier notes mixed three useful but non-interchangeable views. Keep them
separate:

1. **Authoring lifecycle:** how evidence becomes a releasable task.
2. **Measurement stack:** what a trial observes and what each score can claim.
3. **Operating layer:** how a task bank is versioned, calibrated, and improved.

A workflow phase is not a score, a rubric check is not a latent competency, and
a mid-difficulty panel is not a task-authoring method. Treating these as one flat
list causes schema drift and overclaiming.

## 2. Authoring lifecycle: expertise to executable task

| Stage | Canonical object | Required benchmark-design primitives | Evidence / release question | Current executable home |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Elicit | Evidence-bearing expert or source claim | trusted source, cue, caveat, expert/novice contrast, confidence | Who asserted this, from what evidence, and at what strength? | `expertise-transfer.schema.json`: contributors, claims, provenance |
| 2. Decompose | Domain primitive | hidden requirement, contradiction, decision threshold, artifact convention, failure signature, preference, safety/compliance constraint | What irreducible judgment changes competent work? | expertise-transfer primitive records |
| 3. Expose | Critical-incident scenario | role, stakeholder decision, stakes, difficulty knob, alternative valid procedure | What situation makes the primitive observable rather than merely described? | expertise-transfer scenarios; `templates/task-metadata.md` |
| 4. Ground | Source pack and trap | source authority, evidence locator, contradiction mechanism, fairness basis | Can success be justified from supplied/allowed evidence, and is the trap professionally legitimate? | expertise-transfer source pack and traps |
| 5. Contract | Artifact and workflow expectation | artifact interface, state transition, workflow ordering, completion threshold | What inspectable state or work product would a professional produce? | expertise-transfer artifact/check crosswalk; benchmark bundle task/artifact contracts |
| 6. Instrument | Check and grader | observable evidence, pass boundary, visibility, root-cause labels | Does each check test a disclosed professional requirement or a fair held-out consequence? | benchmark bundle checks and graders |
| 7. Pilot | Trial and adjudication evidence | counterfactual variant, expert rating, disagreement, invalid-run reason | Does the task discriminate real quality without rewarding leakage or harness accidents? | benchmark bundle trials/traces; expertise-transfer pilot gates |
| 8. Release | Versioned public/private package | public basis, held-out consequence, calibration-only metadata, known limitation | Is the package expert-valid, leakage-reviewed, reproducible, and explicit about its claims? | expertise-transfer release gates; bundle hashes/provenance |

The lifecycle is a graph, not a lossy handoff. The durable lineage is:

```text
claim → primitive → scenario/source/trap → artifact/workflow evidence
      → check/grader → trial observation → adjudication/release decision
```

Every downstream object should be traceable upstream. A synthetic design
hypothesis may enter the graph, but must not be relabeled as expert testimony.
The implemented authoring contract enforces reciprocal mappings and the rule
that a private check tests a consequence of a public basis rather than a hidden
obligation [ET].

## 3. Measurement stack: trial to defensible claim

| Layer | Unit observed | Appropriate claim | Do not infer |
|---|---|---|---|
| Environment validity | tool/service availability, fixture integrity, permissions, timing | the trial had a valid opportunity to complete the task | agent inability from a broken environment |
| Workflow/process | ordered trace events and intermediate states | compliance with an observable professional invariant | latent expertise merely because a disclosed procedure was followed |
| Checkpoint/state | verifiable partial state | meaningful progress and stage-specific capability | professional acceptability of the final artifact |
| Artifact internals | formulas, citations, structure, file properties, maintainability | technical correctness and inspectable construction quality | stakeholder preference or release readiness |
| Artifact presentation/judgment | clarity, usability, visual/professional conventions | judged quality on declared dimensions | objective correctness when no deterministic check supports it |
| Human preference | blinded pairwise choice | relative preference in the sampled expert population | an absolute approval threshold |
| Human readiness | independently calibrated accept/reject threshold | release/deployment acceptability under stated stakes | universal preference or fine-grained automated-score validity |
| Safety/compliance | authorization, prohibited action, policy consequence | compliance with declared constraints | task success as a reason to waive safety |
| Efficiency | cost, latency, retries, human-review time | quality-resource tradeoff for a versioned system | capability independent of provider/harness configuration |
| Diagnosis | failed check plus causal trace slice | plausible root and surface failure under an explicit attribution method | causal certainty from an unvalidated LLM diagnosis |

Store these score families separately. Aggregation is a versioned policy, not a
natural property of the task. LH-Bench supports observable-boundary rubric
engineering and broad aggregate ranking convergence, but its weak individual
human/automated agreement warns against treating judge scores as perceptible
professional-quality intervals [LH]. STRACE motivates linking a failed check to
a compact causal slice while retaining uncertainty about an LLM-inferred graph
[ST].

### Failure attribution vocabulary

Use three coordinates rather than one flat failure tag:

1. **Validity owner:** `agent`, `task_design`, `grader`, `environment`, or
   `indeterminate`.
2. **Surface stage:** where failure became observable (retrieval, calculation,
   tool execution, artifact construction, verification, presentation, safety).
3. **Root capability/process:** the earliest supported cause (planning, source
   authority selection, evidence reconciliation, threshold judgment, state or
   context tracking, tool use, artifact convention, verification/recovery,
   stakeholder judgment).

A surface build error may originate in source selection; an unattributed timeout
may be environmental. Preserve event locators and attribution confidence so
later adjudication can revise the diagnosis without changing raw evidence.

## 4. Intervention, instrument, and system identity

A benchmark trial evaluates a configured system, not an abstract model. Version
and hash these independently:

- base model and decoding policy;
- harness/scaffold and memory policy;
- public skill/procedure package;
- tool interfaces and permissions;
- task/source/environment version;
- rubric and check set;
- grader code, prompt, and model;
- runtime feedback policy;
- retry/adaptation policy.

The public skill is an **intervention**; the rubric is a **measuring instrument**.
When both derive from the same expert model, shared boundaries can improve judge
consistency but also create evaluator-cue compliance. The minimum causal matrix
is no-skill/public-skill × independent/shared-rubric, with exact-rubric
disclosure only as an explicit leakage/compliance condition [LH].

For adaptive systems, also pin stream order/seed, warmup, similarity groups,
reset cadence, update budget, and which feedback may enter memory. Once one test
item changes behavior on the next, the estimand is ordered-stream learning, not
independent pass@1 [ACE].

## 5. Operating layer: task bank to living instrument

| Object | Purpose | Required controls |
|---|---|---|
| Full task bank | construct coverage and periodic absolute calibration | domain/primitive coverage, versioning, expert validity, full-run history |
| Routine evaluation panel | lower-cost ranking or regression checks | historical difficulty, held-out rank-fidelity validation, population/scaffold label, drift trigger |
| Diagnostic/critical set | preserve rare safety, compliance, and expert traps | never remove solely because checks are too hard/easy for rank discrimination |
| Response matrix | empirical memory of attempts | task/check, model, scaffold, skill/tool/feedback policies, outcome, cost, timestamp, versions |
| Private calibration layer | references, grader internals, difficulty/features, adjudications | access control, provenance, non-leakage into agent-visible context |
| Drift/saturation monitor | detect stale difficulty and changed task behavior | periodic full runs, score/rank separation, missingness and invalid-run audit |
| Candidate lesson store | improve authoring and systems without silent doctrine drift | provenance, feedback authority, scope, contradiction links, held-out promotion, rollback |

A reduced panel serves **ranking efficiency**, not automatically diagnostic
coverage or absolute professional-quality estimation. Mid-range checks often
carry the most rank information, while rare hard safety/contradiction checks may
be strategically indispensable. Keep separate panel objectives and report rank
fidelity separately from score calibration [EB, AP].

## 6. Family map: what each benchmark pattern contributes

| Pattern / examples | Primary reusable object | Main validity risk | Evidence status here |
|---|---|---|---|
| Artifact-centered professional work (AA-Briefcase, MBABench, WorkstreamBench) | multi-file deliverable and correctness/internals/presentation contracts | polished output hides unsupported analysis; subjective dimensions dominate | landscape/triage; local AA source material, no dedicated deep review yet |
| Stateful workflow (SaaS-Bench, Workflow-GYM, OdysseyBench) | persistent environment, stage checkpoints, final-state verification | infrastructure failures and tool familiarity confound capability | full-text triage in `reports/daily/2026-07-10-morning.md`; no dedicated deep reviews yet |
| Skill-grounded long-horizon evaluation (LH-Bench) | expert procedure → observable boundary → artifact/check crosswalk | intervention/instrument contamination; agreement mistaken for validity | full immutable v2 PDF/text and deep review [LH] |
| Trace diagnosis and recovery (STRACE, LH-Bench recovery analysis) | dependency-aware causal slice; error→feedback→repair→verification chain | inferred root cause may be wrong; post-test optimization can leak | extracted-paper deep review [ST] plus LH-Bench full review |
| Psychometric operation (Efficient Benchmarking, Agent Psychometrics) | response matrix, difficulty/discrimination, reduced ranking panel, scaffold-aware analysis | historical population drift; ranking panel drops rare diagnostic coverage | extracted-paper deep reviews [EB, AP] |
| Continual/context adaptation (ACE) | immutable local delta and candidate-lesson lifecycle | order dependence, weak-feedback pollution, private-test contamination | full immutable v3 PDF/text and deep review [ACE] |
| Production agent evaluation (Anthropic, AWS) | task/trial/grader/trace separation and operational failure taxonomy | engineering guidance may not establish benchmark construct validity | source map/preliminary only; deep-review queue tasks remain open |

“Deep review” above means the cited local full text was read in the corresponding
review; “triage” and “preliminary” are not promoted to equivalent evidence.

## 7. Design invariants

1. **Public basis, private consequence:** private checks may hide implementation,
   examples, weights, or perturbations, but not invent undisclosed obligations.
2. **Observable boundaries, plural valid procedures:** grade consequential states
   and artifacts; do not force one sequence unless ordering is itself expert- and
   outcome-grounded.
3. **Separate intervention from instrument:** independently version skills,
   rubrics, graders, tools, and feedback.
4. **Separate score families:** process, checkpoint, artifact, preference,
   readiness, safety, efficiency, and diagnosis remain distinct until a declared
   aggregation policy is validated.
5. **Separate root from surface:** every failure attribution retains raw event
   evidence and uncertainty.
6. **Separate invalid trials from capability failures:** environment, task, and
   grader defects remain visible rather than being silently excluded.
7. **Preserve lineage:** consolidation links or supersedes claims; it does not
   erase provenance or disagreements.
8. **Calibrate for the intended claim:** ranking, diagnosis, and absolute
   readiness require different samples and checks.
9. **Firewall evaluation evidence:** private checks/reference answers cannot feed
   an agent-visible skill or lesson on the same split.
10. **Promotion requires independent evidence:** schema completeness or improved
    training-set score is not enough to change durable benchmark doctrine.

## 8. Unresolved tensions and required experiments

| Tension | Current evidence | Resolution experiment |
|---|---|---|
| Public procedure improves execution vs leaks evaluator cues | LH-Bench's rubric agreement improves, but execution ablation is only seven paired runs and the skill/rubric roles are confounded [LH]. | Four-condition skill × rubric-source ablation on one pilot; compare artifact/readiness outcomes, not process score alone. |
| Automated agreement vs professional validity | LH-Bench judges agree more under expert boundaries, yet individual human/automated concordance is weak [LH]. | Two-expert readiness labels and pairwise choices on a stratified pilot subset; calibrate each automated check against both. |
| Mid-difficulty efficiency vs rare critical coverage | Psychometric work favors informative middle checks; benchmark mission requires hard safety and expert traps [EB, AP]. | Maintain separate ranking and critical diagnostic sets; test rank fidelity and primitive coverage independently. |
| Workflow compliance vs latent expertise | Observable transitions are more judgeable, but exact procedure following can substitute for judgment [LH]. | Include at least two expert-approved procedures and held-out consequence variants. |
| Learning from failures vs benchmark contamination | STRACE/ACE support localized lessons; ACE also degrades under weak feedback and changes the online estimand [ST, ACE]. | Quarantine lessons, validate on held-out scenario clusters, and audit private-evidence flow before promotion. |
| Aggregate leaderboard vs diagnostic instrument | Reduced rankings are cheaper, while root-cause layers produce more actionable but uncertain claims [EB, ST]. | Report both without one composite; evaluate whether diagnoses predict expert-prescribed remediations on repeat trials. |

None of these tensions currently requires a Level 2 strategic decision. The
first pilot can gather the discriminating evidence before choosing a public
leaderboard posture.

## 9. Prioritized build sequence

This sequence consolidates existing queue work rather than creating duplicate
requests:

1. **`build-procedural-skill-eval-contract`:** add typed intervention/instrument
   versions, leakage boundary declarations, score tiers, and recovery edges.
2. **`build-pilot-scenario`:** instantiate the existing expertise-transfer and
   benchmark-bundle contracts with two valid procedures and explicit difficulty
   knobs; mark it non-releasable until expert/pilot gates pass.
3. **Pilot execution slice:** after the skeleton exists, add fixtures/runs for the
   four skill × rubric conditions and two-expert threshold calibration. Create a
   separate queue task only when the pilot exposes the exact runner/grader need.
4. **`build-compounding-lesson-contract`:** keep lesson evolution downstream of
   trustworthy trial/adjudication evidence; do not optimize doctrine against an
   unvalidated pilot.
5. **Production-method updates:** integrate pending Anthropic/AWS deep reviews
   into this taxonomy only where they add or contradict a canonical object.
