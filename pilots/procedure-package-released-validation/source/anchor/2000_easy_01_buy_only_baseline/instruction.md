Supply plans must be created to fulfill each outstanding Sound Privacy Panels customer order listed.

- Coral Clinics: 4 units due in 6 days (pretax budget cap $1,922)
- Ironside Exchange: 7 units due in 7 days (pretax budget cap $3,318)
- Element Productions: 12 units due in 8 days (pretax budget cap $5,425)
- Spire Studios East: 9 units due in 8 days (pretax budget cap $4,363)

On-hand finished stock covers 27 units. There is no in-house manufacturing route for the finished product, so any shortfall has to come from vendors.

Across all units covered through new purchasing or manufacturing, keep portfolio-level new-spend margin at or above 28.7% at selling price.

## Background & Policy

* Cover every customer order while following all stated policies and constraints.
* The combined units covered through new purchasing or manufacturing must clear at least 28.7% portfolio-level new-spend margin at selling price.
* Use the finished stock on hand where it helps satisfy the stated policies and constraints.
* You must create and confirm the necessary sales orders and purchase orders.
* Customer budgets are pre-tax amounts.
* Link Sales Orders to the related Purchase Orders for traceability.
* For finished goods POs, put the SO reference(s) (e.g. S00030 or S00030, S00031) into the origin field ('Source' in the UI).
* In the end, the lineage must be SO -> PO.
* You must sell this product at List Price.
* On sales orders, set the commitment date.
* On purchase orders, you must set the delivery date.
* Review Internal Notes/comments on stock, customers, and vendors before you confirm entries in the ERP.

Capacity constraints:
- No in-house manufacturing capacity is available.
- For each finished-goods supplier offer, respect min/max quantities as horizon-wide totals.
- Use one consolidated PO per supplier offer (do not split a single offer across multiple POs).
- Check each vendor's Internal Notes in Odoo for maximum order quantity limits.

## Execution Autonomy

Work with full autonomy. Do not ask the user for confirmation, approval, or preferences before acting. Make the best valid plan from the available Odoo data and execute it completely in Odoo. If multiple feasible plans satisfy the constraints, choose the one that best optimizes the stated objective.

# Odoo Environment

You have access to an Odoo ERP instance with the following credentials:

- **Host:** 127.0.0.1
- **Port:** 8069
- **Database:** bench
- **API Key:** stored in `/etc/odoo/api_key`

## How to Access Odoo

You can write and execute Python scripts using the `odoo-client-lib` library to interact with Odoo via the JSON-2 API:

```python
import odoolib

# Connect to Odoo via JSON-2 API
connection = odoolib.get_connection(
    hostname='127.0.0.1', protocol='json2', port=8069,
    database='bench', password=open('/etc/odoo/api_key').read().strip()
)

# Get model proxies
Product = connection.get_model('product.product')
Partner = connection.get_model('res.partner')
SaleOrder = connection.get_model('sale.order')
SaleOrderLine = connection.get_model('sale.order.line')
PaymentTerm = connection.get_model('account.payment.term')
InvoiceWizard = connection.get_model('sale.advance.payment.inv')

# Example: Search for products (use named kwargs)
product_ids = Product.search(domain=[('default_code', '=', 'SPP-001')])
if product_ids:
    data = Product.read(ids=product_ids, fields=['name', 'qty_available', 'list_price'])
    for p in (data if isinstance(data, list) else [data]):
        print(f"Product: {p['name']}, Stock: {p['qty_available']}, Price: ${p['list_price']}")

# Example: Create a sale order
customer_ids = Partner.search(domain=[('ref', '=', 'customer_001')])
so_ids = SaleOrder.create(vals_list=[{
    'partner_id': customer_ids[0],
    'note': 'Urgent order'
}])
so_id = so_ids[0]

SaleOrderLine.create(vals_list=[{
    'order_id': so_id,
    'product_id': product_ids[0],
    'product_uom_qty': 25,
    'price_unit': 450.00
}])

# Example: Confirm sale order
SaleOrder.action_confirm(ids=[so_id])
```

## Common Odoo Models

- `res.partner` - Customers, vendors, contacts
- `product.product` - Products
- `product.supplierinfo` - Vendor pricing and lead times (`min_qty`, `price`, `delay`); **no `max_qty` field exists** — read vendor capacity limits from `res.partner.comment` (Internal Notes) instead
- `sale.order` / `sale.order.line` - Sales orders
- `account.payment.term` - Payment terms
- `sale.advance.payment.inv` - Sales invoice wizard (regular invoices and down payments)
- `purchase.order` / `purchase.order.line` - Purchase orders
- `account.move` - Invoices and bills
- `stock.move` - Inventory movements
- `stock.picking` - Deliveries and receipts
- `mrp.production` - Manufacturing orders
- `mrp.workorder` - Manufacturing work orders and workcenter assignments
